# Pin Microsoft Copilot to the navigation bar

As an admin, you can encourage your organization to use Microsoft Copilot by pinning Copilot to the navigation of Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 App, including [microsoft365.com](https://www.office.com/), Microsoft 365 desktop app, and the Microsoft 365 mobile app.  

Admin pinning allows you to set Microsoft Copilot to appear on the navigation bar for users with Microsoft Copilot access. This setting is only applicable for users who are signed in with a Microsoft Entra ID. Users can personalize their navigation bar by choosing to pin or unpin Microsoft Copilot, overriding the admin's default settings.

## Before you begin

Before you can pin Copilot, you must be authenticated with Microsoft Entra ID.  

Global administrators and Copilot administrators can access this setting in the Microsoft 365 admin center by navigating to **Copilot** > **Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> Admin pinning is only applicable to users who are authenticated with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Pinning options

1. **Default setting**: By default, Microsoft Copilot is not pinned. Users receive a prompt asking if they want to pin Microsoft Copilot.
1. **Automatic pinning (recommended by Microsoft)**: Microsoft Copilot is automatically pinned for all users. Users will not be prompted.
1. **No automatic prompts to pin**: Microsoft Copilot is not automatically pinned, and users will not receive automatic prompts to pin.

## End user experience

Users can adjust the pinning settings within their application preferences, and these choices are specific to each Microsoft 365 app, Microsoft 365 website ([microsoft365.com](https://www.office.com/) and [m365.cloud.microsoft](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/)), Microsoft 365 Windows app, and Microsoft 365 mobile.

For example, if you choose to pin Microsoft Copilot for all users, but an individual user decides to unpin it from Teams or Outlook or microsoft365.com, Microsoft Copilot will no longer appear on the navigation bar for that user.

## When Copilot will be pinned in each app

If you choose to pin Microsoft Copilot for all users, it will be pinned in the Microsoft 365 app (web, Windows, mobile) starting mid-September. Microsoft Copilot will be pinned in Microsoft Teams and Outlook soon after.
