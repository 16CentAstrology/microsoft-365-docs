# Which Copilot is right for your organization?

Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered virtual assistant. It uses large language models (LLMs) to answer your questions using a prompt and response interaction.

There are different Copilots available. This article describes the different Copilots and can help you decide which Copilot is right for you or for your organization.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot

✅ Use for work tasks  
✅ Licensed by your work organization  
✅ Can use for personal tasks, but use caution. This Copilot accesses work data.  
✅ Personally licensed by end users

**Microsoft 365 Copilot** is licensed by your work organization. In Microsoft 365 apps, like Teams and Word, you use Copilot to help you with your work tasks. Microsoft 365 Copilot is also available at [https://m365.cloud.microsoft/](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/) and there's a Microsoft 365 Copilot app that can be installed on devices in your organization.

Copilot accesses data that your Microsoft Entra account has access to, like your emails and files.

For example, you can use Microsoft 365 Copilot to:

- Find information in your emails and documents
- Create summaries of long documents
- Create meeting agendas and get a meeting summary
- Summarize information into a document, presentation, or email
- Create images and add these images to your work
- Get answers to questions about your work or company, like the vacation policy

When users sign in with their Microsoft Entra account, they can use Microsoft 365 Copilot **work** or **web** version:

INSERT SCREENSHOT

- When users select **work**, Copilot shows results that the user's Microsoft Entra account can access.
- When users select **web**, Copilot shows results that the user's Microsoft Entra account can access and also shows results from the internet.

End users can also purchase their own license that includes Copilot. For example, users with a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription might be able to purchase this Copilot.

- [Microsoft 365 Copilot plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot)

## Microsoft Copilot

✅ Use for personal tasks  
✅ Free consumer version  

**Microsoft Copilot** is a consumer version and is available for free. It can help you with personal tasks and uses information from the internet. You can use it for nonsensitive work tasks, but be cautious. Never add sensitive or proprietary work information in a prompt.

For example, you can use Microsoft Copilot to:

- Help you draft an email or get guidance on how to write an email, like creating an accessible email for different disabilities
- Create guidelines or rules for your office break area
- Get answers from the internet, like how to write a resume
- Create images for a specific task, like a birthday card for a colleague

Microsoft Copilot is available at [copilot.cloud.microsoft](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft), in Microsoft Edge, when you use Microsoft Bing, and the Copilot app.

When users access this Copilot on their work devices, if Microsoft 365 Copilot is enabled for the users, then it's possible it will redirect to Microsoft 365 Copilot (`https://m365.cloud.microsoft`). If it does redirect, they can choose the **work** or **web** version:

INSERT SCREENSHOT

- When users select **work**, Copilot shows results that the user's Microsoft Entra account can access.
- When users select **web**, Copilot shows results that the user's Microsoft Entra account can access and also shows results from the internet.

✅ Licensed by your work organization

**Microsoft Security Copilot** helps security professionals with incident response, threat hunting, intelligence gathering, posture management, and more. It can access work or school data that the security professional's Microsoft Entra account has access to.

Microsoft Security Copilot also integrates with other services, like Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Entra, and some non-Microsoft services.

You can use Security Copilot to:

- Get a summary of a threat incident
- Create incident reports
- Learn more about an Intune setting configured on a device
