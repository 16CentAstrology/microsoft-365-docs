# Accept membership to a shared booking page

As an admin, you want to know how staff can accept membership when they're added to a Shared Booking page.

## Email Invitation

When a staff member is added to a Shared Booking page by the owner or another staff member, they receive an email invitation from Microsoft Bookings. The email includes a link to join the shared booking page. Once the staff member accepts the invite to join the shared booking page, they can select the link to open the Bookings app in Microsoft 365 and see the details of the Shared Booking page.

## Accepting membership through Microsoft 365

Alternatively, the staff member can access the Shared Booking page from the Bookings app in Microsoft 365.

1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with their work or school account.
2. Go to the **Bookings** app.
3. Locate the shared booking pages they have been invited to.
4. Select the Shared Booking page and choose **Accept** to accept the membership.

A shared booking page can have three states:

- **Accepting bookings** - the staff member has joined the shared booking page.
- **Approve to receive bookings** - the staff member hasn't approve membership.
- **Not accepting bookings** - the staff member has declined to accept bookings.

For more information on adding staff, see [Add staff to Bookings](add-staff.md).

## Requirements for accepting membership

To accept the membership, the staff member needs to have a Microsoft 365 account with a license that includes Bookings. If the staff member doesn't have a Microsoft 365 account or a license for Bookings, they won't be able to join the Shared Booking page. They need to contact the owner or another staff member of the Shared Booking page to request a Microsoft 365 account or a license that includes Bookings.
