# Set up appointment notifications for your staff

Microsoft Bookings allows you to streamline your appointment scheduling process, ensuring efficient time management for your staff. You can configure notification settings to alert your staff members whenever a booking is created or modified.

If **Enable text message notifications for your customer** is selected, SMS messages are sent to the customer, but only if they opt in.

Reminders and notifications are sent out to customers, staff members, or both, at a specified time before the appointment. Multiple messages can be created for each appointment, according to your preference.

## Configure notification settings

1. From the Bookings app dashboard, select **Services** located on the top menu.
2. Choose the service you want to configure notification settings for.
3. On the **Notifications** page, you can send SMS messages, set up reminders, and send notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Text message notifications in Bookings require a Teams Premium license.
