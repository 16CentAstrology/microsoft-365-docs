# Preview and share your personal booking page

The personal booking page is a crucial tool for sharing your availability with others, enabling them to easily schedule appointments with you. This feature provides a streamlined process for selecting meeting types, dates, and times and allows other people to book easily with you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only meeting types set up to be **public** will appear on your personal booking page. To learn more about public meeting types, see [Create new meeting type](create-new-meeting-type.md).

## Preview the customer experience

To see how the appointment booking process works for your clients and customers, select the **copy** icon next to the **Personal booking page** heading. This will copy the link to your personal booking page, allowing you to share it or open it in a new tab for previewing.

When you open this link in a new tab, you'll see your client and customer facing booking page. Once an appointment is booked, you and your customer will receive a confirmation email.

## Share your personal booking page

Microsoft Bookings offers several ways to share your personal booking page with your customers. Sharing your personal booking page is essential for connecting with your customers and streamlining the appointment scheduling process.

### Sharing Options

There are three ways you can share your personal booking page.

1.  **Copy Link and Share**: Copy your booking page link and paste it where you want. You can add it to a Teams chat or your social media profiles. This allows you to reach a broader audience and makes booking appointments easier for clients and customers.
2.  **Share via email**: Enter the email addresses of the person you want to share your booking page with. You can add a customized message.
3.  **Email signature settings**: Add your booking page link to your email signature. This means every time you draft or send any email, your booking page will automatically be embedded in your email signature.

### Share meeting types

All meeting types in personal bookings can be shared individually by clicking on the **Share** icon present on the meeting tile. This link can be copied and shared via email. There is also the option of making the link valid only for one booking for private meetings.

Maximize the visibility of your personal booking page and streamline the appointment scheduling process for your customers by sharing your personal booking page.
