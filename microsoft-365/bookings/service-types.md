# Creating personalized and group services in Microsoft Bookings

Microsoft Bookings is a powerful scheduling tool in Microsoft 365 Business Basic that allows you to create and manage online appointments for your customers. Depending on your business needs, you may want to offer services that involve multiple staff members and customers. In this article, we will guide you through the process of creating personalized (1:N) and group (N:N) services in Microsoft Bookings.

## Service types in Microsoft Bookings

- **1:1 service** One staff member meets with one customer (default service type).
- **1:N service** One staff member meets with multiple customers at the same time.
- **N:N service** Multiple staff members meet with multiple customers at the same time.

>[!NOTE]
> To create a service, you must be added as an administrator (staff role). See [Understanding staff roles](staff-roles.md) for more information.

## Creating a 1:N Service

1. On the Bookings page, select **Services** from the left-hand menu.
2. Select **Add a service**.
3. In the **Maximum number of attendees** field, set the desired number of customers who can join the appointment. The default value is 1, which creates a 1:1 service.
4. Go to the **Assign staff** tab and select the radio button **Assign any of your selected staff for an appointment**. This ensures that only one staff member is assigned per booking, even if multiple staff members are available for the service.

## Creating a N:N Service

1. On the Bookings page, select **Services** from the left-hand menu.
2. Select **Add a service**.
3. In the **Maximum number of attendees** field, set the desired number of customers who can join the appointment. The default value is 1, which creates a 1:1 service.
4. Go to the **Assign staff** tab and select the radio button **Assign all of your selected staff for an appointment**. This ensures that all selected staff members are assigned to the appointment.

Complete the rest of the service details, such as name, description, location, duration, price, and availability, then select **Save**.

Your new service will now be visible on your Services list and Booking page. Customers can book the service according to the staff and customer capacity you have set. You can also edit or delete the service at any time.
