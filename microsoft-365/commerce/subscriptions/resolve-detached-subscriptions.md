# Resolve detached subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center

When you buy a subscription from a Microsoft partner and that partner leaves the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) program, they no longer manage your subscription. We call these subscriptions *detached subscriptions*. Without an associated partner, if you take no action, the subscription will expire, and you'll lose access to your data and all associated apps and services. This article explains your options for resolving a detached subscription, either by finding a new partner or buying a subscription directly from Microsoft.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid data loss or service disruptions, you must buy a subscription for the same product or service that you currently have with a partner and assign licenses to the same users.
<!--
## Find a detached subscription

When you sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center, or when you open Outlook, OneNote, PowerPoint, or Excel, you see a banner that says to avoid losing access to your subscription, you must update the subscription details. Select the **View details** link in the warning to learn which subscriptions are affected, and what you must do to keep your subscriptions in good standing.

## Options to resolve a detached subscription

If you have a detached subscription, you have two options:

1. **Find a new CSP partner** through the partner marketplace.
2. **Buy a subscription** directly from Microsoft.

### Find a new partner

If you choose to find a new partner, you can explore available partners through the [Partner Directory on AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-dir?filter=services%3DLicensing). This site lets you search for partners based on your specific products and requirements. When you contact a new partner, make sure to ask if they're a CSP. To learn more about working with a partner, see [Manage Microsoft-certified solution provider partner relationships](../manage-partners.md).

### Buy a subscription directly from Microsoft

When you buy a subscription from Microsoft, you have a direct relationship with us for billing and support. To learn more, see [Learn how to buy a new subscription](../try-or-buy-microsoft-365.md#buy-a-different-subscription) and [Explore Microsoft 365 for business support plans](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-for-business-support-options?msockid=15af1489bfd667952f27000abefb66ef).
