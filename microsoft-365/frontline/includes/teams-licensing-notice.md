Starting April 1, 2024, Frontline worker suites (F1/F3) are available in versions with and without Microsoft Teams. Customers can choose between the *existing F1 and F3 suites with Teams included* or the *new versions of those suites without Teams*. 

New Enterprise customers who wish to provide workers with both Teams and the value in existing Microsoft 365 (E3/E5) or Office 365 Enterprise suites (E1/E3/E5) need to purchase two SKUs: one Microsoft 365 (no Teams) or Office 365 (no Teams) suite and one Teams standalone (Microsoft Teams Enterprise or Microsoft Teams EEA).

For Enterprise customers in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, this change became effective on October 1, 2023.

Enterprise customers already subscribed to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 suites that include Teams prior to April 1, 2024, can continue to use, renew, upgrade, and otherwise adjust their subscriptions that include Teams as before.
