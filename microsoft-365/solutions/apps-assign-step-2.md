# Step 2. Assign apps to users, groups, and devices



## Assign initial apps to your organization

### Company Portal

If your organization is managing apps with Intune, you need to use the Company Portal app. End users at your organization use the Company Portal to securely access company data and do common tasks. End users can access these tasks and information using either the Company Portal app, Company Portal website, or Intune app. The Company Portal app supports iOS/iPadOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows devices. The Intune app supports Android devices.

Intune allows you to customize the Company Portal so that it better supports your organization. Specifically, you can set the Company Portal branding, support information, enrollment, privacy, notifications, device categories, app sources, and self-service actions.

> [!NOTE]
> The "Company Portal" is commonly used as the descriptor for the Intune app, Company portal app, and the Company portal website.
> 
> You don't need to use the Company Portal if you are only managing devices (MDM). If you are using **MAM** or **MDM + MAM**, you need to use the Company Portal.
