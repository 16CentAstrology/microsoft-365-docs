# Step 3. Verify and monitor app assignments

Microsoft Intune provides a variety of reports to help monitor apps. These reports help you understand whether apps are licensed, installed, protected, configurated, or restricted. You can also monitor indiviual apps and monitor apps on individual devices.

## Understand app reports

You can use reports in Intune to help verify and monitor app licenses. You can also determine which apps are discovered and installed on a device. If you've applied app policies, you can determine which apps are configured and protected that use those policies. Intune also provides a report to help you determine which apps are restricted on a devices and which apps are co-managed by Intune and Configuration Manager.

### App licenses report

Intune provides a list of all the app licenses your tenant currently has in use. For details about this report, see [Monitor app licenses used in Intune](/microsoft-365/solutions/apps-license-manage#monitor-app-licenses-used-in-intune) and [Monitor app information and assignments with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-monitor).
