# Use a prebuilt model to detect sensitive information from documents in Microsoft Syntex

The prebuilt *sensitive information model* analyzes and detects key information from documents. The model recognizes documents in various formats and [detects sensitive information](/azure/ai-services/language-service/personally-identifiable-information/concepts/entity-categories#entity-categories), such as personal identification numbers, personal physical and email addresses, phone numbers, and personal financial or health information. This model can also extract key sensitive information when selected.

## Set up a sensitive information model

To create and configure a sensitive information model, follow these steps:

<!---
- Step 1: [Create a sensitive information model](#step-1-create-a-sensitive-information-model)
- Step 2: [Select the information types to detect](#step-2-select-the-information-types-to-detect)
- Step 3: [Configure the information to detect](#step-3-configure-the-information-to-detect)
- Step 4: [Configure the information to extract](#step-4-configure-the-information-to-extract)
- Step 5: [Test the model](#step-5-test-the-model)
- Step 6: [Apply the model](#step-6-apply-the-model)

### Step 1: Create a sensitive information model

--->

1. Follow the instructions in [Create a model in Syntex](create-syntex-model.md#set-up-a-prebuilt-model) to create a prebuilt sensitive information model. Then continue with the following steps to complete your model.

2. On the **Models** page, in the **Add entities to detect** section, select **Add entities**.

    ![Screenshot of the new models page showing the Add entities to detect section.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-add-file-to-analyze-sensitive-info.png)

3. On the **Configure detection** page:

    - Select the language you want to use for this model. Only one language can be selected for each model. This model supports languages for both [handwritten text](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/language-support#handwritten-text) and [print text](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/language-support#print-text).

    - Select the sensitive information types you want to detect, and then select **Next**.

4. On the **Configure extraction** page, select the sensitive information types you want to extract, and then select **Next**.

5. On the **Test model** page, select **+Add files** to select sample files to test your model.

    ![Screenshot of the Test model page.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-sensitive-test-model.png)

    If the test is successful, you'll see the entities that were detected in the library column.

6. On the **Apply model** page, select **Finish** to apply the model to detect sensitive information in files.

    ![Screenshot of the Apply model page.](../media/content-understanding/prebuilt-sensitive-apply-model.png)

    Entities that are extracted are displayed in columns in the document library.

For information about file types, languages, optical character recognition, and other considerations for this model, see [Requirements and limitations for models in Microsoft Syntex](requirements-and-limitations.md#prebuilt-models).
