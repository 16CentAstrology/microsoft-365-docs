# Analyze section revisions in the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

Section revision analysis is an AI-powered feature that helps maintain consistency with company-approved language. It detects changes in embedded sections, summarizes these changes, and offers suggestions.

This feature helps agreement creators and reviewers take the best next steps based on the analysis. Approvers can also benefit from using this feature to get a comprehensive view of the section modifications before approving the document and proceeding to the next step.

Once you [create a document using a template](agreements-create-template.md), and make changes to any sections based on business requirements from internal and external stakeholders, you can run the **Analyze section revisions** feature.

To analyze the section revisions, follow these steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Word document you want to analyze.

2. Select **Agreements** > **Generate Documents**, and then select **Analyze section revisions** to start the analysis.

    It takes a short period of time for the AI based analysis to complete. The feature  identifies all the revised sections from the source template and provides a brief summary for each one.

3. To make further modifications in the sections, select **Refresh results** to view the latest analysis.

4. Select **View details** to review changes of any section that interests you.

    Selecting **View details** provides further information on the revised section. It contains three parts:

    - **Text difference** – Shows the changes made to the modified section.
    - **Summary** – Provides an AI-generated summary of the changes made to the section.
    - **Suggestions** – Provides suggestions to align the revised section with the source template.

5. After you make changes in the relevant section’s details pane, select **Refresh results** to see the latest analysis.

6. Based on the analysis, you can either modify the section and use the **Refresh results** option to rerun the analysis, or ignore the revision if it's not needed for the document.
