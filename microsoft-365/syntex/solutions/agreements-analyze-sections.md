 ## Analyse section revisions ##

Section Revision analysis is a powerful tool that gives you an AI-powered analysis of section revisions to avoid inconsistencies with company approved language. This feature is designed to detect when changes have been made to an embedded section and to provide a summary of the changes, and provide suggestions, thereby enabling the agreement creator or reviewer to take the next best action based on the analysis.

Once you have created a document using a template using [create an agreement](agreements-create-template.md), and as per the business requirement from internal and external stakeholders have made changes to any of the sections, you can choose to run Analyse section revisions.

To analyse the section revisions, do the following steps:

1. With the Word document open and the Agreements > Generate Documents pane open, select Analyse Section Revision to start the analysis. It takes a short period of time for the AI based analysis to complete, where all the sections that are revised from the source template are identified and a short summary of the revisions is presented for every revised section. 
1. Once you are in the pane, and you make further modifications in the sections, you can click on _Refresh results_ to view the latest analysis.
1. You can click on View details to review changes of any particular section of your interest.
1. Clicking View details provides further information on the revised section. It contains three parts -
   - Text difference - It presents the textual difference of the section that was modified
   - Summary - It presents an AI-generated summary of the modifications that were made in the section.
   - Suggestions - It presents suggestions to align the revised section with the one present in the source template.
1. Once you are in the relevant section's details pane and you make further modifications to the section. Click on Refresh result to view the latest analysis.
1. Based on the analysis, the agreement creator / reviewer now has the option of modifying the section and using the Refresh result option to re-run the analysis, or if the revision is in fact desired for the specific document and it can also be safely ignored.

The section revision analysis option is also available for approvers who can approve the document so that they can get a comprehensive view of the section modifications before approving the document and proceed to next step.
