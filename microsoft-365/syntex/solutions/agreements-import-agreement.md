# Import an agreement in SharePoint Agreements AI

You can add existing agreements by uploading signed documents. Select a file to be imported as a signed agreement. Details about the agreement will be automatically detected after you save.

To import an agreement, follow these steps:

1. From the Agreements app in Microsoft Teams, start an import by using either of these two methods.

    - On the **Home** tab, select the **Import an agreement** card.

    - On the **Agreements** tab, select the **Import** button.

2. On the **Import signed agreements** page, browse to and pick the file that you want to import. The file must be a PDF.

3. Choose the workspace where the agreement should be stored, and then pick the category to which the agreement belongs.

4. Select **Next** to process the file and detect fields.

5. Once processing is complete, review the extracted values and confirm if they're correct. If a field isn't applicable, leave it blank.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The values in the fields can't be changed later.

6. Select **Save** to confirm the import. The imported agreement will be visible in the list of agreements.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take a few hours for the new agreement to be indexed and show up in the list of agreements.
