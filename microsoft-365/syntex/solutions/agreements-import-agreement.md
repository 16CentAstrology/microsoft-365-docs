# Import an agreement in the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

> [!NOTE]
> For the complete list of articles to help you set up and use this feature, see [Documentation](agreements-overview.md#documentation).

You can add existing agreements by uploading signed documents. Select a file to be imported as a signed agreement. Details about the agreement will be automatically detected after you save.

To import an agreement, follow these steps:

1. From the Agreements app in Microsoft Teams, either select the **Import** card on the home page, or select the **Import** button in the Agreements list.

2. Browse and pick the file that you want to import. The file must be a PDF.

3. Choose the workspace where the agreement should be stored, and then pick the category to which the agreement belongs.

4. Select **Next** to process the file and detect fields.

5. Once processing is complete, review the extracted values and confirm if they're correct. If a field isn't applicable, leave it blank.

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values can't be changed later.

6. Select **Save** to confirm the import. The imported agreement will be visible in the list of agreements.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take a few hours for the new agreement to be indexed and show up in the list of agreements.
