# Licensing requirements for the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

To activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution on your tenant, the tenant administrator must first add a product license. After you obtain the product license, individual user licenses can be assigned to the users who will use the SharePoint Agreements AI product within your organization.

## Obtain the SharePoint Agreements AI license

SharePoint Agreements AI Solution is available for selective General Availability (GA). The selective GA is by invitation only. Contact your Microsoft representative or submit your nomination for the selective GA here: [Sign up for selective GA](https://aka.ms/AgreementsSelectiveGA).

## Assign the SharePoint Agreements AI license to a user

When the licenses are available in the **Your products** page, you can assign the licenses to existing users using the regular Microsoft 365 license assignment process.

1. Assign licenses by following the guidance in [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

2. After you assign a license to a user, the new license will show up in their user information panel.

3. Once the user has the correct license for the SharePoint Agreements AI product, you can assign them roles within individual agreement workspaces to work within the Agreements solution.  For information about how to assign different roles to workspaces, see [Assign workspace roles](agreements-setup.md#assign-roles).
