# Licensing requirements for the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

To be able to activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution on your tenant, a product license needs to be added by the tenant administrator. Once the product license has been obtained, individual user licenses can be applied to the users who will be using the SharePoint Agreements AI product within the business.

## Obtain the SharePoint Agreements AI license

The license is applied via the regular marketplace process for adding products to the tenant.

1. Add the license by following the guidance in [Buy or remove licenses for a Microsoft business subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses).

2. Add the product **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements (Preview) Trial** to your products.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The license name of the product name is subject to change in the future.

3. After adding the product, you will see it on the **Your products** page.

## Assign the SharePoint Agreements AI license to a user

When the licenses are available in the **Your products** page, you can assign the licenses to existing users using the regular Microsoft 365 license assignment process.

1. Assign licenses by following the guidance in [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).

2. After assigning a license to a user, the new license will show up in their user information panel.

3. Once the user has the correct license for the SharePoint Agreements AI product, you can assign them roles within individual agreement workspaces to work within the Agreements solution.  For information about how to assign different roles to workspaces, see [Assign workspace roles](agreements-setup.md#assign-roles).
