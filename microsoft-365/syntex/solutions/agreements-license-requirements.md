If your nomination is selected, a Microsoft representative will reach out to you within 7 business days.

# Licensing requirements for SharePoint Agreements AI

To activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution in your tenant, the tenant administrator must first get the **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** license. After you obtain the license, you need to assign the license to users who will use the solution within your organization.

## Get the license

SharePoint Agreements AI is now General Available (GA) for early adoption customers. This limited GA is by invitation only. Contact your Microsoft representative or submit your nomination here to obtain licenses: [Sign up for selective GA](https://aka.ms/AgreementsSelectiveGA).

## Assign the license to users

Once the **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** licenses are available in the **Your products** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can assign licenses to existing users by following the guidance in [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users). Users who need to use SharePoint Agreements AI need to have the **SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial** license assigned to them.
