## SharePoint Agreements AI licensing requirements.

To be able to activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution on your tenant, a product license needs to be added by the tenant administrator. Once the product license has been obtained, individual user licenses can be applied to the users who will be using the SharePoint Agreements AI product within the business.

### Obtaining the SharePoint Agreements AI license

The license is applied via the regular marketplace process for adding products to the tenant. The steps for adding new products are documented here. [Buy or remove licenses for a Microsoft business subscription | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses?view=o365-worldwide)

Follow the guidance and add the product SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements (Preview) Trial to your products.

> [!NOTE]
> This product name is subject to change in the future

After adding the product, you should see it on the Your products page

### Assigning the SharePoint Agreements AI license to a user

When the licenses are available in the Your products page, you can assign the licenses to existing users using the regular M365 license assignment process. These steps are documented here. [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users)

After assigning a license to a user the new license will show up in their user information panel.

Now that the user has been assigned the correct license to use the SharePoint Agreements AI product they can be assigned roles within the individual agreements workspaces to be able to work within the Agreements solution. How to assign different roles to workspaces is detailed here. [Assign_workspace_roles](solutions/agreements-setup.md#assign-roles)
