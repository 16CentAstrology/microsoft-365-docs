# Licensing requirements for the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

To activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution on your tenant, the tenant administrator must first add the "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements (Preview) Trial" licenses. After you obtain the license, individual user licenses can be assigned to the users who will use the SharePoint Agreements AI solution within your organization.

## Obtain licenses for the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

SharePoint Agreements AI solution is available for selective General Availability (GA). The selective GA is by invitation only. Contact your Microsoft representative or submit a nomination to get the "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements (Preview) Trial" licenses here: [Sign up for selective GA](https://aka.ms/AgreementsSelectiveGA).

## Assign license to a user

When the "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements (Preview) Trial" licenses are available in the **Your products** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can assign licenses to existing users by following the guidance in [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).
