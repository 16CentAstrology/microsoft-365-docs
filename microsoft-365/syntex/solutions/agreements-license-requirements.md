# Licensing requirements for the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

To activate the SharePoint Agreements AI solution on your tenant, the tenant administrator must first add the "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial" licenses. After you obtain the license, you need to assign the license to users who will use the SharePoint Agreements AI solution within your organization.

## Obtain licenses for the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

SharePoint Agreements AI solution is available for selective General Availability (GA). The selective GA is by invitation only. Contact your Microsoft representative or submit your nomination here to obtain licenses: [Sign up for selective GA](https://aka.ms/AgreementsSelectiveGA).

## Assign license to a user

When the "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial" licenses are available in the **Your products** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can assign licenses to existing users by following the guidance in [Assign or unassign licenses for users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users). Note that all users who will use the SharePoint Agreements AI solution need to have "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements Trial" license assigned to them.
