# Approval notifications in SharePoint Agreements AI

Agreement approval notifications will be sent through the Approvals App in Teams. Agreement creators can also choose to notify via email.

The process to configure and send approvals is provided in [Create a template with the SharePoint Agreements AI solution](agreements-create-template.md). This article provides the actions a recipient of the notification for an approval request can take.

## View requests in the Approvals app

1. When a request for approval is sent to you, you will receive an approval notification as a notification in Microsoft Teams.

2. You can also go to the [Approvals app in Microsoft Teams](/power-automate/teams/native-approvals-in-teams#use-the-approvals-app-in-teams) to see all your current approvals regardless of status. You can filter the requests by status (**Requested**, **Approved**, or **Canceled**). 

3. You can select the request title to see more details about the request.
     For requests where you are the approver, you can **Approve**, **Reject** or **Reassign** the requset. You can also provide additional comments before taking an action.
     For requests you created, you can choose to **Follow up** or **Cancel the request**.

4. You can also open the agreement in Microsoft Word by selecting the link.
