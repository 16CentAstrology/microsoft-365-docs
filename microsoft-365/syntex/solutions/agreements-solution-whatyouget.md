# What you get with the SharePoint Agreements AI Solution

- An Agreements App in Microsoft Teams. This is the central place for you to manage your agreements, create new templates, and generate agreements from templates. You can also upload signed agreements to organize them in one place and get insights on agreements expiring soon.
- An Agreements tab in Microsoft Word that helps you author templates and agreements. You can use the Agreements tab in Microsoft Word to author templates by adding fields and sections. You can also add approval workflow in your templates so that when you generate agreements from these templates, they get routed for approval automatically. You can use the Agreements tab in Word to draft new agreements from published templates by filling in field values. 
- AI capabilities that help you manage the life cycle of your agreements. When you upload signed agreements, AI automatically extracts important information, such as second party name, expiration date etc., so that your agreements are organized and searchable.

> [!NOTE]
> You need "SharePoint Content Solution - Agreements" license to access capabilities in SharePoint Agreements Solution, including the Agreements tab in Word. For additional details, see Licensing Requirements <link to page for licensing requirements>.
