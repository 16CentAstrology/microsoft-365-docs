# Update a template with the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

Templates have their own lifecycle management requirements and will change over time as a business updates its requirements for the content of structure of agreements.

## Choose a template to edit

1. Select the Microsoft Word Agreements Add-in.

2. Select **Manage templates** to open the **Manage templates** panel.

3. In the **Get started** section, select **Edit a template**.

    This will open a dialog for the user to select the workspace where the template to be edited is located.

4. Choose the appropriate workspace to see the Modern Template Library for that workspace.

5. Select the Modern Template Library to show a list of all the templates for editing.

6. Select the template you want to edit, and then select **Open template**.

## Prepare to edit the template

When the template to be edited is opened, the right-hand panel in Word will populate with a variety of information including the status of the template (draft or published), the template metadata such as location languages and additional fields, sections and conditional section information.

The right-hand panel will also contain additional information such as approval details and settings about who can edit the template.

To put the template into editable mode, follow these steps:

1. At the top of the panel, select **Edit template**.

    A pop-up message appears to inform you that a new draft version of this template will be created to edit and the published version will still be available for existing document authors.

2. To proceed to edit the template, select **Edit template**. If you decide you don't want to edit the template, select **Cancel**.

## Edit the template

After you select **Edit template**, you are presented with the same experience as the [create a template](agreements-create-template#configure-an-approval-workflow-for-documents-generated-from-the-template) flow. In this case, the fields, sections, conditional sections plus any workflow or additional are already in place from the original template.

You can make modifications as desired to update the elements of the template. and then publish it so that document authors can use it to generate new agreements.

To edit the template, follow these steps:

1. Make the changes you want to the template.

2. Select **Publish template**.

    A pop-up message appears that asks you confirm or return to editing.

3. When published, you receive a message that informs you that the new version has been published. The right-hand panel will show the updated template details as before.
