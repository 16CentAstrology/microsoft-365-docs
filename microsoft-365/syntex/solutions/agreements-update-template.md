Templates have their own lifecycle management requirements and will change over time as a business updates its requirements for the content of structure of agreements.

## Choosing the template to edit ##

Select the Microsoft Word Agreements Add-in.

Select Manage Templates to open the Manage Templates right hand panel.

In the Get started section choose Edit a template

This will open a dialog for the user to select the workspace where the Template to be edited is located.

Choose the appropriate workspace which will in turn present the Modern Template Library for that workspace.

Selecting the Modern Template Library will then show a list of all the Templates for editing.

Select the Template you wish to edit and click Open template.

## Preparing to edit the template ##

When the template to be edited is opened the right-hand panel in word will populate with a variety of information such as the status of the template (draft or published), the template metadata such as location languages and additional fields, sections and conditional section information.

The right-hand panel will also contain additional information such as approval details and settings about who an edit the template.

To put the template into editable mode, click the Edit template button close to the top of the panel.

After clicking Edit template a pop up will inform the user that a new draft version of this template will be created to edit and the published version will still be available for existing document authors. 

The Template editor can choose to proceed to edit the template or don't edit and cancel the flow.
 
## Editing the template ##

After clicking edit template, the template editor is presented with the same experience as the create template flow. In this case, the fields, sections, conditional sections plus any workflow or additional are already in plase from the original template.

The template author can make modifications as desired to update the elements of the template and then publish it so that document authors can use it to generate new agreements.

Clicking Publish template generates a popup that asks the user to confirm or return to editing.

On clicking publish, the template author is informed that the new version has been published and the right-hand panel will show the updated template details as before.
