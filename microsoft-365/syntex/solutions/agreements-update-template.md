# Update a template with the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

Templates have their own lifecycle management requirements and will change over time as a business updates its requirements for the content of structure of agreements.

## Choose a template to edit

1. Select the Microsoft Word Agreements Add-in.

2. Select **Manage templates** to open the **Manage templates** panel.

3. In the **Get started** section, select **Edit a template**.

4. Choose the appropriate workspace to see the Modern Template Library for that workspace.

5. Select the Modern Template Library to show a list of all the templates for editing.

6. Select the template you want to edit, and then select **Open template**.

## Prepare to edit the template

When the template to be edited is opened, the right-hand panel in Word will populate with a variety of information including the status of the template (draft or published), the template metadata such as location languages and additional fields, sections and conditional section information. At the top of the panel, select **Edit template**.

## Edit the template

After you select **Edit template**, you are presented with the same experience as the [create a template](agreements-create-template#configure-an-approval-workflow-for-documents-generated-from-the-template) flow. In this case, the fields, sections, conditional sections plus any workflow or additional are already in place from the original template.

You can make modifications as desired to update the elements of the template and then publish it so that document authors can use it to generate new agreements.

Note: Until you publish the tempalte withe the changes, the changes will not reflect in new documents generated from the template. All documents generated from the template will follow the details as per the last published version of the template.
