# Pre-requisites for using the SharePoint Agreements AI solution.

The SharePoint Agreements AI solution has several pre-requisites to enable users to make full use of the solution features. 

### Software licensing
Users of the solution will need to be licensed for access to the following,
 - SharePoint Content Solution â€“ Agreements Trial.
 - Microsoft SharePoint Online.
 - Microsoft Teams.
 - Microsoft Word.

#### Microsoft Word specific requirements.
Several features of the SharePoint Agreements AI solution require a new tab to be added to the Microsoft Word ribbon. This tab is titled Agreements and will show automatically when the correct user licensing is in place.
The Agreements tab requires a minimum version and update channel of Microsoft Word. 

The Microsoft Word minimum version needs to be September 2024 (16.0.17830.20000) or later and the update channel needs to be set to the Current Channel (CC) or the Monthly Enterprise Channel (MEC).
To discover  more about how to determine the Microsoft Word version and update channel please see [Overview-of-update-channels-for-M365 Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/updates/overview-update-channels).
