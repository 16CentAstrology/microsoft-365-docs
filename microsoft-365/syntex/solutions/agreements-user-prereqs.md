# Prerequisites for using the SharePoint Agreements AI solution

The SharePoint Agreements AI solution has several prerequisites to ensure users can fully use all of its features.

## Software licensing

Users of the solution need to be licensed for access to the following products:

 - SharePoint Content Solution â€“ Agreements Trial
 - Microsoft SharePoint Online
 - Microsoft Teams
 - Microsoft Word

### Microsoft Word specific requirements

Several features of the SharePoint Agreements AI solution require a new tab to be added to the Microsoft Word ribbon. This tab is titled **Agreements** and shows automatically when the correct user licensing is in place.

The **Agreements** tab requires a minimum version and update channel of Microsoft Word.

The Microsoft Word minimum version needs to be September 2024 (16.0.17830.20000) or later, and the update channel needs to be set to the Current Channel (CC) or the Monthly Enterprise Channel (MEC).

To learn more about how to determine the Microsoft Word version and update channel, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/updates/overview-update-channels).
